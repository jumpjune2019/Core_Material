	a) if any key but 1) 2) or 3) are selected

// folder: compare
3) Create a utility to compare two files using command prompt arguments
		hint: FileInputStream could be used
		
		> Compare file.txt file2.txt
		
		Output: file.txt and file2.txt:
		Result: identical content
				character length for both: XX
		  or
		Result: different content
				character length for file.txt: XX
				character length for file2.txt: YY

				
// folder: phone		
4) Create an application which does the following:

	creates a two-dimensional array which will hold phonebook data;

	Rows are records
	Column 0 = name
	Column 1 = phone number
	Column 2 = city
	
	Ensure you can input 5 rows of data using keyboard entry
	
	Upon completion, ensure you can print both on screen and on file "phone.txt" the info which has been displayed.
	
	The output on both screen and display should be as follows:
	
	PhoneBook App
	Name		Phone		City
	asas		asas		asas
	
	5 rows of data
	
	the file will be formatted in the exact same way.
	
	Added requirement, if any entry is empty, a custom exception is raised and the user is asked to retry again
	
	Added requirement, when a user enters a row of data, they get a feedback message displaying the entered data in a line and the ability to either accept the row of the data or type a new row of data.
